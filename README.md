# Employee Attrition Analysis
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for analyzing employee attrition data. The project aims to uncover patterns and insights into employee turnover, providing valuable information for improving employee retention strategies.

### Dataset Source:  

The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle: IBM HR Analytics Attrition & Performance(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)  
Please refer to the original source for more details on the data and its collection methodology.

### Key Features:

Database Setup: Created a MySQL database and table to store and manage employee attrition data.  
Data Loading: Utilized Python and SQLAlchemy to load data from CSV into MySQL.  
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed and visualized key features of the dataset.  
Correlation Analysis: Examined correlations between various factors and employee attrition.  
Visualization: Generated plots to understand distributions and relationships in the data.  
Power BI Report: Developed a Power BI report for advanced data visualization and insights.  

### Technologies Used:

Python: Utilized for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.  
MySQL: Used to create and manage the database and tables.  
Pandas: Employed for data manipulation and analysis.  
SQLAlchemy: Used for database interaction and data loading.  
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Created visualizations to explore data patterns and relationships.  
Power BI: Developed interactive reports and dashboards.  


### Database Implementation:

Created a MySQL database named employee_attrition.  
Defined a table schema to store employee data, including attributes such as age, attrition status, job role, and various performance metrics.  

### Exploratory Data Analysis:

Loaded and examined the dataset to understand its structure and key features.  
Conducted basic statistical analysis to summarize the dataset.  
Visualized the distribution of employee attrition and age.  

### Correlation Analysis:

Converted categorical attributes to numerical format where necessary.  
Computed and visualized the correlation matrix to identify relationships between different factors and employee attrition.  

### Power BI Report:

Created an interactive Power BI report to provide visual insights into the data.  
The report includes key metrics, trends, and visualizations related to employee attrition.
